Take you current project SUT (system under test) and answer the following questions:
	* Should we implement automation on the project? Why?
	* What we can automate? Why?
	
In case you already have automation on your project:
	* Calculate ROI (Return on investment) based on manual and automated testing price


For RIO calcualtion you can use the following formula:
       Net profit
ROI =  -----------
		Investment
		
Net profit = Cost of manual testing - Cost of Automation
Cost of Automation = Framework set up + Scenarios development + Execution (human job) + Result analyzis

       Cost of manual testing - (Framework set up + Scenarios development + Execution + Result analyzis)
ROI =  	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					Framework set up + Scenarios development + Execution + Result analyzis
					
					
E.g. 

Project duration - 5 Years

Manual testing cost: 20 man-hour per week * 5 years * 52 weeks = 5200 man-hours
Automated tests development cost: 80 man-hours setup framework + 40 man-hours per week scenario development * 0.5 years * 52 = 1120 man-hours
Automated test execution & result analyzis: 8 man-hours per week * 5 years * 52 = 2080 man-hours

ROI = (5200-(1120+2080))/(1120+2080)= 62.5%
